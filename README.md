## 🚀 Overview

**Secure Audio Codec** turns your text into a WAV file by assigning every character its own tone (frequency). The exact mapping is shuffled with a secret key or a SHA‑256 hash, so only someone who knows the key can re‑assemble the tones back into readable text. The whole workflow – encoding, decoding, and a dark‑theme GUI – sits in a single `secure_audio_codec.py` file.

## ✨ Features

- **Key‑Based Encryption** – Any string works as a key; a built‑in dialog can hash it to SHA‑256 for extra entropy.
- **Text ↔ Audio** – Encode messages to `.wav`; decode them back to plain text.
- **Unicode Friendly** – Supports ASCII, digits, punctuation, and Czech diacritics out of the box.
- **Minimal Dependencies** – Only `numpy`, `soundfile`, and the Python standard library.
- **Clean Dark GUI** – Built with `tkinter`, so it runs everywhere Python does.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or newer**

### ⚙️ Installation

Install the two run‑time dependencies in one go:

```bash
pip install numpy soundfile
```

> **Tip ▶︎** If you like reproducible installs, drop this into a `requirements.txt` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`:
>
> ```
> numpy
> soundfile
> ```

---

### 🖥 Usage

Start the app:

```bash
python secure_audio_codec.py
```

#### GUI Walkthrough

1. **Choose Mode** – `Encrypt` **or** `Decrypt`.
2. **Enter / Generate Key** – Type anything or click *Generate SHA‑256*.
3. **Encrypt Mode**
   - Type a message in the bottom pane.
   - Press **Run**, pick a filename, and a WAV pops out.
4. **Decrypt Mode**
   - After choosing the mode, a file dialog opens – pick the WAV you want to read.
   - Press **Run** to reveal the hidden text.

---

### 🧪 Testing

No automated tests (yet), but you can sanity‑check manually:

1. Launch the program.
2. Encrypt the string `Hello world!` using key `test123`.
3. Decrypt the saved WAV with the same key.
4. Verify the output equals `Hello world!`.

---

## 🛣 Roadmap

- Add automated tests for encoding/decoding.
- Support additional audio formats (e.g., MP3).
- Implement key strength validation.
- Add support for more Unicode character sets.
